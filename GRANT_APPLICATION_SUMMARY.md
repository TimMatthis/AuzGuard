# AuzGuard: Sovereign AI Gateway for Regulated Industries
## Grant Application Summary

---

## Executive Summary

**AuzGuard** is a next-generation AI governance platform designed to enable regulated industries to safely adopt artificial intelligence while maintaining full compliance with data sovereignty, privacy, and security requirements. As organizations across healthcare, finance, government, and legal sectors seek to leverage AI capabilities, they face a critical challenge: **how to innovate with AI while ensuring sensitive data never leaves sovereign boundaries and all decisions are auditable, explainable, and compliant.**

AuzGuard solves this problem by providing an intelligent gateway that sits between applications and AI models, enforcing policy-based controls, routing requests to compliant models, and maintaining cryptographically-verifiable audit trails. The platform enables organizations to confidently adopt AI technology while meeting stringent regulatory requirements including GDPR, HIPAA, Australian Privacy Act, and sector-specific regulations.

### Problem Statement

The rapid advancement of AI technology presents a paradox for regulated industries:
- **Innovation Imperative**: Organizations must adopt AI to remain competitive and meet customer expectations
- **Regulatory Constraints**: Strict data sovereignty, privacy, and compliance requirements prevent use of many AI services
- **Compliance Complexity**: Organizations struggle to audit AI decision-making and prove regulatory compliance
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Dependence on single AI providers creates risk and limits flexibility
- **Data Residency**: Sensitive data must remain within sovereign boundaries (e.g., Australian data in Australia)

### Solution Overview

AuzGuard provides a comprehensive AI governance platform that addresses these challenges through:

1. **Policy-Based Access Control**: Dynamic rule engine evaluates every AI request against customizable compliance policies
2. **Intelligent Routing**: Directs requests to approved AI models based on data classification, residency requirements, and compliance needs
3. **Multi-Provider Support**: Vendor-agnostic architecture supporting OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, local models, and sovereign AI providers
4. **Immutable Audit Trail**: Cryptographically-verifiable logs provide complete transparency and regulatory compliance
5. **Data Sovereignty**: Ensures sensitive data only accesses AI models within approved jurisdictions
6. **Override Mechanisms**: Compliance-controlled exceptions for edge cases with full audit trails

## Technical Innovation

### Core Technology Components

#### 1. Policy Engine (CEL-Based Expression Language)

AuzGuard implements a custom Common Expression Language (CEL) interpreter that evaluates complex compliance rules in real-time:

**Capabilities:**
- Logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`
- Comparisons: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Set operations: `in`, membership testing
- Functions: `has()`, `contains()`, `regex_match()`, `starts_with()`, `ends_with()`, `length()`

**Example Policy Rules:**
```
// Healthcare: Prevent offshore routing of patient data
data_class in ['health_record', 'medical_data'] && 
destination_region != 'AU' 
→ BLOCK

// Finance: Require oversight for high-value transactions
transaction_amount > 10000 && 
personal_information == true 
→ REQUIRE_OVERRIDE (compliance_officer)

// Government: Development environments use local-only models
environment in ['development', 'testing'] && 
data_classification == 'sensitive' 
→ ROUTE_TO (local_ollama_pool)
```

#### 2. Intelligent Routing Engine

Sophisticated decision-making system for optimal AI model selection:

**Routing Factors:**
- **Compliance**: Data classification, residency requirements, certifications
- **Performance**: Latency, throughput, availability metrics
- **Cost**: Per-token pricing, budget optimization
- **Capabilities**: Model features, context windows, multimodal support
- **Load Balancing**: Weighted distribution, health checks, failover

**Example Routing Configuration:**
```yaml
onshore_compliant_pool:
  region: AU
  compliance: [IRAP, ISO27001, Privacy_Act]
  targets:
    - provider: openai_sydney
      weight: 60%
      latency_p95: 180ms
    - provider: google_melbourne  
      weight: 25%
      latency_p95: 210ms
    - provider: local_llama
      weight: 15%
      latency_p95: 240ms
      cost_tier: economy
```

#### 3. Cryptographic Audit System

Military-grade audit trail using blockchain-inspired techniques:

**Hash Chain Implementation:**
- Each audit entry cryptographically linked to previous entry
- Tampering detection: Any modification breaks the chain
- Entry hash: SHA-256(payload_hash + prev_hash + metadata + salt)

**Merkle Tree Batching:**
- Periodic batch verification (configurable: 1000 entries)
- Merkle root provides single proof for entire batch
- Efficient verification without examining every entry
- Supports regulatory audit requirements

**Audit Entry Structure:**
```json
{
  "id": "audit_xyz123",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-11T10:30:45Z",
  "org_id": "healthcare_org_001",
  "rule_id": "HIPAA_PHI_ROUTING",
  "effect": "BLOCK",
  "actor_id": "nurse_station_05",
  "payload_hash": "sha256:abc...",
  "prev_hash": "sha256:def...",
  "merkle_leaf": "sha256:ghi...",
  "redacted_payload": {
    "data_class": "protected_health_information",
    "destination": "offshore_provider",
    "patient_id": "***REDACTED***"
  }
}
```

**Compliance Benefits:**
- ✅ **Immutability**: Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) architecture
- ✅ **Non-repudiation**: Cryptographic proof of decisions
- ✅ **Privacy**: Selective field redaction
- ✅ **Efficiency**: Batch verification with Merkle proofs
- ✅ **Integrity**: Continuous chain verification

#### 4. Model Garden (Multi-Provider Support)

Unified interface to diverse AI providers:

**Supported Providers:**
- **Cloud Commercial**: OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Cohere
- **Cloud Sovereign**: AWS Bedrock (Sydney), Azure OpenAI (Australia)
- **Local Deployment**: Ollama, vLLM, HuggingFace Inference
- **Specialized**: Medical AI (IBM Watson Health), Legal AI, Financial models

**Provider Connectors:**
```typescript
// Abstracted interface - provider-agnostic application code
const response = await modelGarden.invoke({
  policyId: 'healthcare_au_v1',
  request: {
    prompt: "Analyze patient symptoms...",
    data_class: 'health_record',
    patient_id: 'P12345'
  },
  preferences: {
    pool_id: 'hipaa_compliant_pool',
    max_latency_ms: 500,
    cost_priority: 'balanced'
  }
});

// AuzGuard automatically:
// 1. Evaluates compliance policies
// 2. Selects appropriate provider from pool
// 3. Routes request to compliant model

// 5. Returns response with compliance metadata
```

**Connector Features:**
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker for failing providers
- Response streaming support
- Token counting and cost tracking
- Performance metrics collection
- Health check monitoring

#### 5. Override Management System

Compliant exception handling for edge cases:

**Override Workflow:**
1. **Detection**: Policy identifies request requiring override
2. **Authorization**: Checks actor role against allowed override roles
3. **Justification**: Optionally requires written justification
4. **Execution**: Performs action with enhanced audit logging
5. **Review**: Flags for compliance review in audit dashboard

**Example Override:**
```typescript
// Emergency medical scenario
Policy Rule: "Block offshore AI for patient data"
Override Request: {
  actor_role: "emergency_physician",
  justification: "Critical diagnosis, local AI unavailable, patient consent obtained",
  emergency_level: "life_threatening"
}
Result: ALLOW_WITH_OVERRIDE
Audit: Flagged for compliance review within 24 hours
```
